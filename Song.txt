All of Me
John Legend

What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

How Am I Supposed to Live Without You
Michael Bolton

I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'
Someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the
plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

You Are Not Alone
Michael Jackson

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Shape of You
Ed Sheeran

So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Perfect 
Ed Sheeran
